# Serverless REST API with DynamoDB and API Gateway

## Project Overview
### Project Name: Serverless REST API
### Architecture: Serverless
### Description:
This project develops a serverless REST API using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB to manage a simple to-do list or customer records. The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations without server management.

## Key AWS Services Used
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Exposes REST endpoints to clients.
- **AWS Lambda**: Handles CRUD operations in a serverless environment.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for record storage.
- **AWS IAM**: Manages access via roles and permissions.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logs and monitors API activity.
- **Amazon S3**: Hosts the static front-end application.

## Architecture Diagram
The architecture includes:
- **Frontend**: Users access via a website hosted on Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront.
- **API Gateway**: Routes HTTP requests (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to AWS Lambda.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes requests and interacts with DynamoDB.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores and manages data for CRUD operations.
- **IAM**: Secures access with appropriate permissions.
- **CloudWatch**: Provides execution logs and metrics.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Scalability**: Design scalable, event-driven serverless applications.
- **API Implementation**: Use API Gateway with Lambda for stateless execution.
- **Database Management**: Apply best practices with DynamoDB.
- **Security**: Secure APIs using IAM roles and resource policies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup AWS Services
- Configure **Amazon S3** for static website hosting.  
- Set up **Amazon API Gateway** with REST endpoints.  
- Create **AWS Lambda** functions for CRUD operations.  
- Initialize **Amazon DynamoDB** with a table.  
- Define **IAM roles and policies** for secure access.  

### 2. Frontend Development
- Develop a web interface with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.  
- Host the frontend on **S3** and enable **CloudFront** for distribution.  

### 3. API Development
- Implement Lambda functions for **GET, PUT, POST, DELETE** requests.  
- Connect **Lambda** to **DynamoDB** for data persistence.  

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Integrate **Amazon CloudWatch** for execution logs and performance metrics.  

### 5. Testing and Deployment
- Test **API endpoints** and frontend functionality.  
- Deploy the application and verify **scalability**.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Use **environment variables** in Lambda for configuration.  
- Implement **error handling and validation** in Lambda functions.  
- Optimize **DynamoDB table design** for performance (e.g., partition keys).  
- Regularly review **IAM policies** to ensure **least privilege access**.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add **Amazon Cognito** for authentication.  
- Implement **API rate limiting** in API Gateway.  
- Enhance monitoring with **custom CloudWatch dashboards**.
